Overview
This Verilog project implements a simple car racing game on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platform. The game utilizes a PS2 controller for user input and generates audio and video output. The objective is to navigate a car on the screen and avoid obstacles.

Hardware Requirements
FPGA development board
PS2 controller
Audio output device (e.g., speaker or headphones)
